# Kinja

Ruby gem for posting to Kinja (currently only supports Burner accounts)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kinja'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kinja

## Usage

```ruby
# Create an instance of the kinja client
client = Kinja::Client.new(
  user: "username",
  password: "password"
)

# Create a post
post = client.create_post(
  headline: '',                       # required
  body: '<p>This is a post</p>',      # required
  status: 'PUBLISHED',                # optional (default is "DRAFT")
  replies: false                      # optional (default is true)
)

# Get a post
post = client.get_post("http://gawker.com/lapd-claims-the-jinx-had-nothing-to-do-with-robert-durs-1691730232")

# ...OR...

post = client.get_post("1691730232")
```

## Todo
* Refactor: Shouldn't need to log in to fetch a post
* Find API endpoint to update a post
* Build out other common REST endpoints
